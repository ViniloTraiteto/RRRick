# Rapid Reroller Richard

TnH Character based on Ricky Dicky Random but with extra attackers, encryptions and with a focus on constantly switching your arsenal.

Each supply gives you a free attachment and grenade. You get ONE token per hold to claim extra ammo for one of your guns or an entirely new gun!
Intended for 5 hold limited ammo mode but can work for endless limited ammo.

(Completely loses its purpose if played on spawnlock but if you like it that way go on! I can't stop you!)

#### Got bug reports? Opinions? I'm all ears (eyes?) on the main H3VR Discord

## Changelog
### 1.0.0
- initial release
### 1.0.1
- Filtered out "less desireable" ammo types. Hopefully no more CSGas or flares.
